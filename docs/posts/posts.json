For beginners to Bayesian statistics, I recommend starting with Kruschke (2014), or McElreath (2020). Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al. (2013) is the definitive textbook on the topic, and recommended for more mathematically oriented and/or advanced readers.\n“Bayesian evaluation of behavior change interventions: a brief introduction and a practical example” (Heino, Vuorre, and Hankonen 2018) (pdf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelman, Andrew, John B.
