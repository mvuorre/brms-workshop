## Workshop materials

This workshop's materials are written in [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), so you can download the source code and follow along on your own computer. We assume some familiarity with R, and recommend the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) IDE. 

To get started, download the materials from <https://github.com/mvuorre/brms-workshop>, extract the package to your location of choice, and double click the `brms-workshop.Rproj` to open up an RStudio session in that directory. Alternatively, use this R command to download the files and open up the project:

```
# install.packages("usethis")  # Install if you don't have it
usethis::use_course("mvuorre/brms-workshop")
```

The materials of this workshop are collected as a [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) website: Each lesson's materials can be found under the `_posts/` directory. To run the computations on your computer, open the relevant `.Rmd` file (with the brms-workshop project active in RStudio).
